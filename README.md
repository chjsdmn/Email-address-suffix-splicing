# email
write your email address
When the user does not have any input, the prompt box disappears
When the user enters characters, a prompt box is displayed, and the content entered by the user is automatically spelled with the mailbox suffix to display. Like "user input + @+ commonly used mailbox suffixes". 
When the user input contains the @ symbol, we select the character before the @ input by the user to join with the suffix to make sure the format of email address is always reasonable.
When the user enters @ and part of the suffix, only the suffix that meets the user's input expectations is selected.
When the user input does not meet any suffix matching, all prompts are displayed.
User can choose from the list both by clicking the item and by pressing arrowup, arrowdowm and enter from the keyboard.
Background Color is added when the item is hoved or selected.
